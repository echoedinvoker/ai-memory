File: /home/matt/dotfiles/nvim/.config/nvim/lua/ai-memory/python/test.py
```python
from .utils.sum import sum

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(sum(1, 2))
```

```sh
 python -m python.test
2
```

答案應該是 3, 但是為什麼上面 print 出來是 2?

AI:
Yarr, me hearty! There be somethin' fishy with that code showin' 2 instead o' 3. Let's scour through the depths o' the files to find the treasure o' truth!

First, I'll be needin' to see what be in that sum function ye be usin'. Let me check the utils file:Blast me barnacles! There's yer problem, ye scurvy dog! 

The function be called "sum" but it ain't doin' no summin' at all! It be multiplyin' the numbers instead o' addin' 'em! 

In yer code:
```python
from .utils.sum import sum

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(sum(1, 2))
```

Ye be callin' `sum(1, 2)` expectin' it to give ye 3 (which would be correct if it were addin'), but the function actually be doin' `return x * y` which gives ye 2 (because 1 × 2 = 2).

To fix this bilge-suckin' bug, ye need to change the `sum.py` file to:
```python
def sum(x, y):
    return x + y
```

Then ye'll get yer proper 3 as expected. That's why pirates prefer to name functions properly - less confusion when sailin' the high seas o' code!
